# Analyze Data with Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric

## 📌 Project Summary

In this project, I analyzed sales order data using Apache Spark within the Microsoft Fabric environment. The data was uploaded to Fabric's Lakehouse, and operations such as filtering, grouping, and transformations were performed using Spark notebooks.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Create a workspace and a lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric  
- Upload order data in CSV format  
- Analyze data using Spark notebooks  
- Filter and group customer, product, and sales information  
- Perform data transformations on DataFrames  

---

## 🧪 Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Microsoft Fabric Environment
- Created a new workspace and a lakehouse.
- Downloaded the dataset `orders.zip` and uploaded the following files to the lakehouse:
  - `2019.csv`
  - `2020.csv`
  - `2021.csv`

### 2. Create a Notebook and Analyze the Data
- Created a new Apache Spark notebook.
- Explored the datasets and selected relevant columns.
- Removed duplicate records.
- Filtered customers who purchased a specific product.
- Grouped sales quantities by product.
- Analyzed the yearly distribution of orders.
- Extracted year and month values from the date column to enrich the dataset.
